This program solves tetromino puzzles.

### What is a Tetromino Puzzle?

A tetromino is a shape made up of four squares, with each square connected along its sides.
There are 5 different types of tetrominoes, as shown below:

- I-shaped tetromino
- L-shaped tetromino
- T-shaped tetromino
- O-shaped tetromino
- Z-shaped tetromino

The goal of the puzzle is to arrange the tetrominoes to fit into a specific shape, usually a rectangle.
If two patterns are symmetrical or one can be rotated to match the other, they are considered identical.

This program offers three different types of puzzles:

### find4x2.rb

The rectangle is a 4x2 grid.
You can use two identical tetrominoes.
This is the easiest puzzle in the repository.

### find4x4.rb

The rectangle is a 4x4 grid.
You can use two identical tetrominoes, but you must use at least three different types.

### find6L.rb

Use six L-shaped tetrominoes and form a rectangle.

### How to use the programs

1. Install Ruby.
2. Download the files.
3. Run a terminal (a shell in Linux or Command Prompt in Windows).
4. Type "ruby find4x2.rb" in your terminal.
5. Do the same for "find4x4.rb" and "find6L.rb"
